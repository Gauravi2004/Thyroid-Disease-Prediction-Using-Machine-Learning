# Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict thyroid disease from medical data. It involves extensive data preprocessing, handling missing and imbalanced data, clustering for better segmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The project also includes database management for data storage and model serialization for deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, KNN, GridSearchCV)
- Imbalanced-learn (RandomOverSampler)
- SQLite (for data storage and validation)
- Pickle (model serialization)
- Jupyter Notebook (exploratory data analysis and experimentation)

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing including missing value imputation and categorical encoding
- Handling class imbalance using RandomOverSampler
- Clustering data using KMeans to improve model training
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Database integration with SQLite for data validation and storage
- Model persistence using Pickle for easy deployment
